# XPtsp-STYLE BOARD LIST v1.6

[**Written by PI3KUM**](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?action=profile;u=51815) -> [**Forked By Dougiefresh**](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=253913)

------

## Introduction
This mod started when I discovered that it wasn't possible to install both the [Separate Replies and Views Column v1.9.2](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=2536) and [Vbulletin Style Board Index v1.9.2](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=2535)) mods together without conflict between the two.  I merged the two mods together and made a few additional changes of my own in order to make it more my own, such as swapping the topics and replies columns in the BoardIndex and MessageIndex pages.  I also added some additional stuff to the listings like preview of the last post, as well as modified the Unread and Unread Recent templates to seperate the replies and views columns for a more unified appearance.

## Admin Settings
**SMF 2.0:** There is a new setting called **Preview the first post in MessageIndex?** under **Admin** -> **Configuration** -> **Modification Settings**.

## Compatibility Notes
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.14, but should work on SMF 2.0 and up, as well as SMF 2.1 Beta 3.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.

This mod **DOES NOT** work on SMF 2.0.x's Core theme, as many of the modifications that this mod makes are already present in the Core theme.

This mod should be installed **AFTER** the [Responsive Curve](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=4040) mod, if both are to be used.
