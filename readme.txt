[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
It wasn't possible to install both the [url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=2536]Separate Replies and Views Column v1.9.2[/url] and [url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=2535]Vbulletin Style Board Index v1.9.2[/url]) mods together without conflict between the two, so I merged them together and made a few additional changes of my own in order to make it more my own, such as swapping the topics and replies columns in the BoardIndex and MessageIndex pages.  I also added some additional stuff to the listings like preview of the last post....
